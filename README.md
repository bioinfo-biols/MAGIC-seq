# MAGIC-seq Pipeline

The following files/parameters are commonly required :
- FASTQ files (Read 1 containing the spatial information and the UMI and read 2 containing the genomic sequence) 
- A genome index generated with STAR 
- An annotation file in GTF or GFF3 format (optional when using a transcriptome)
- The file containing the barcodes and array coordinates (look at the folder "ids" to use it as a reference).
